The  SPDR S&P Biotech  exchange-traded fund, which tracks a broad selection of biotech names, has shot up 8.9% since September 25, just more than a week ago.  The biotech run-up over the past week or so has been fueled by the same drug-pricing deal between  Pfizer  and President Donald Trump that set off a surge in Big Pharma share prices last Tuesday, along with a spate of acquisitions.  “Investors are naturally jittery, since prior rallies haven’t been sustained,” Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Josh Schimmer and Eric Schmidt wrote in a note on Friday.
