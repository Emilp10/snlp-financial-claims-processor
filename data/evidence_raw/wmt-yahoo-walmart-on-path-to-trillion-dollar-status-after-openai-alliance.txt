The alliance with the Sam Altman-led company was unveiled on Tuesday and will allow Walmart shoppers to browse and purchase products directly on ChatGPT by clicking a “buy” button.  While the offering won’t include fresh foods, customers will be able to purchase items like packaged foods, apparel and more from both Walmart and its Sam’s Club chain.  Walmart shares jumped 5% on the news, their biggest one-day gain since April when tariffs were paused, bringing its market capitalization to more than $854 billion.
