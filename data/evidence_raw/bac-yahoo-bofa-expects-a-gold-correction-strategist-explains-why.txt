Gold (GC=F) hit $4,220 on Wednesday — yet another record high. The precious metal's market moves were partially driven by heightened trade tensions between the US and China, as well as by increased expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts at the October FOMC meeting. Blue Line Futures chief market strategist, Phil Streible, joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to explain why Bank of America (BAC) anticipates a correction in gold and to discuss his predictions for silver (SI=F), platinum (PL=F), and palladium (PA=F).
