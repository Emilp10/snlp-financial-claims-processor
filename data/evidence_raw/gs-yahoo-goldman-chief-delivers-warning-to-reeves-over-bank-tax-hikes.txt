The boss of Goldman Sachs has urged Rachel Reeves not to increase the financial burden on the banking sector amid industry concerns that it will be targeted for steep tax hikes in next month's budget.  Sky News has learnt that David Solomon delivered the warning in a private meeting with the chancellor last week, when he is said to have told her that hitting banks with higher taxes would be damaging to Britain's wider economic growth prospects.
