AstraZeneca  on Friday became the second big drugmaker after  Pfizer  to cut a pricing deal with the White House, announcing an agreement alongside President Donald Trump at a late afternoon press conference.  AstraZeneca stock was up 1.6% in Friday after-hours trading.  AstraZeneca, which is headquartered in the United Kingdom but earned 43% of its revenues in the U.S. in 2024, committed to offer all of its prescription medications to Medicaid at “most favored nation prices”, which means “the lowest price anywhere in the world,” said Trump.
