Lockheed  Martin investors want a so-called clean quarter from the defense contractor, which is scheduled to report its earnings before the market opens on Tuesday.  In the second quarter, Lockheed recognized charges amounting to $5.83 a share after tax, for a total of $1.7 billion.  Partly because of that slide, Lockheed stock was up about 4% year to date coming into Tuesday trading, trailing behind the  by about 10 percentage points.
