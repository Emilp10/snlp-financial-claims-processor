In a year with tariffs, trade wars, and changing electric-vehicle policies,  Ford Motor  investors have another thing to worry about: aluminum.  Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ford was reducing production of five SUV models, following a September fire at a Novelis facility in New York.  Novelis, a large supplier of aluminum sheet to the auto industry, says its plant is expected to be offline until 2026, which leaves auto makers scrambling for alternatives.
