Morgan Stanley and Bank of America both beat Wall Street estimates for third quarter earnings. It was a very special quarter for Morgan as its trading revenue finally surpassed that of rival Goldman Sachs. Goldman has dominated the equity-trading business in recent years. Bank of America also reported earnings that beat estimates on higher investment banking revenue. Bloomberg's Sridhar Natarajan reports on "Bloomberg Open Interest."
