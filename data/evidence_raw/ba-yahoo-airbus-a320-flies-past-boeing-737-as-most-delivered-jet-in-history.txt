STORY: Europe's Airbus broke a major commercial barrier on Tuesday.Its A320 family of planes overtook the Boeing 737 to become the most-delivered jetliner in history.Boeing's decades-old record fell as a jet was delivered overnight to Saudi carrier Flynas.It brings deliveries to 12,260 since the A320 began service just under 40 years ago.That's according to industry data from aviation analytics firm Cirium.Airbus didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The narrow-body jets were originally designed to feed large hubs and later widely adopted by low-cost carriers.Airbus is already the world's largest planemaker by total annual deliveries and it's expanding production in the U.S. and China.Boeing set the standard for narrow-body aircraft production with its popular 737, which was first introduced in the 1960s.But it faced a crisis following two fatal accidents.The company is gradually restoring output under regulatory limits.
