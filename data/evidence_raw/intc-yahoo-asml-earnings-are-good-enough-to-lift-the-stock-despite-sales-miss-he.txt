ASML Holding  reported confident guidance for next year, which could help justify investors’ recent enthusiasm for the chip-making equipment company.  ASML reported third-quarter earnings of 5.49 euros a share ($6.38) on revenue of €7.52 billion.  In its previous earnings announcement, ASML said it expected 15% sales growth this year but tariff uncertainty meant it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026.
