Dr. Peter Marks, the top Food and Drug Administration official whose forced resignation earlier this year set off a panic among biotech investors, is now an executive at  Eli Lilly  the company said on Tuesday.  Marks stepped down as the chief of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in March.  Lilly says he started work this month.
