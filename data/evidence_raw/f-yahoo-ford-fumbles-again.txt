So far this year, Ford Motor Company has faced over 100 recalls, impacting nearly eight million vehicles – a figure equal to roughly four years of its annual production output. Many have been critical of the company’s leadership, noting that Bill Ford has remained executive chairman since 1999 despite repeated management turnovers.
