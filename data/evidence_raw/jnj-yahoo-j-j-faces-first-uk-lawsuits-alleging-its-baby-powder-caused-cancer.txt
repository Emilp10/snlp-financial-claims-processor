STORY: Johnson & Johnson is facing its first lawsuits in the United Kingdom over alleged cancer-causing talc products.That comes as the drugmaker fights tens of thousands of similar claims in the United States.Legal firm KP Law said it filed a lawsuit Tuesday at the English High Court on behalf of 3,000 people who say their ovarian cancer or other diseases were caused by using J&J's baby powder between 1965 and 2023.The firm says J&J's talc products contained carcinogenic fibers, including asbestos which is often linked to mesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer.The value of the lawsuit against J&J and a subsidiary of its former consumer health unit Kenvue, is estimated at just over $1.3 billion.Kenvue said in a statement that J&J baby powder "did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer".J&J stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a cornstarch product.It did the same in the UK in 2023.The company has sought to resolve the tens of thousands of similar lawsuits in the U.S. through bankruptcy.But federal courts rejected the strategy three times.
