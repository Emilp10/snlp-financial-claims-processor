STORY: Beyond Meat's stock soared more than 100% Wednesday morning as retail buyers devoured the company's shares in the latest meme stock craze.With short interest at nearly 82%, Beyond Meat is one of the most shorted stocks in the market, according to data from analytics firm Ortex.That's up from about 64% last week, when Beyond Meat's stock dropped to an all-time low.The company has struggled with weak sales as demand has dropped for its plant-based patties, which has led to job cuts and measures to manage its debt pile.As one analyst put it, Beyond Meat had all the hallmarks of (quote) "the classic meme cocktail." A day earlier, Beyond Meat announced a deal with Walmart to expand distribution of some of its products.That triggered a buying spree by salivating retail traders, who snapped up $35 million worth of Beyond Meat's stock - its biggest single-day purchase on record - with shares skyrocketing nearly 150% on Tuesday.Also on the meme stock menu: shares of Krispy Kreme, which were gobbled up by mom-and-pop traders for their biggest one-day buy since late July, according to data from Vanda Research.Shares of the donut maker, which has also struggled with weak demand as well as a failed McDonald's partnership, climbed more than 30% on Wednesday.
