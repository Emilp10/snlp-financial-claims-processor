(Reuters) -Volatility Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded funds, filed on Wednesday to launch a total of 27 highly leveraged ETFs, including the first-ever proposed 5x ETF for the U.S. market, at a time of rising caution over inflated asset prices as markets continue their upward swing.  Volatility Shares has filed for a 3x and a 5x offering on Strategy, where existing issuers have struggled to manage a 2x product.  Until now, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved single-stock leveraged ETFs with a maximum of 2x.
