Sir Keir Starmer has said the government will not relax visa rules for India, as he embarks upon a two-day trade trip to Mumbai.  The prime minister touched down this morning with dozens of Britain's most prominent business people, including bosses from BA, Barclays, Standard Chartered, BT and Rolls-Royce.  The first full-blown trade mission to India since Theresa May was prime minister, it's designed to boost ties between the two countries.
