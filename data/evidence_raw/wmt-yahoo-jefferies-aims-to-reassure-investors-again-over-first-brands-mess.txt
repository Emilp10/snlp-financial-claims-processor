Shares of  Jefferies Financial Group  rose Monday after the firm’s top brass said its exposure to doomed auto-parts supplier First Brands would be manageable, and that any losses would be “readily absorbable.”  The message underscored the intense scrutiny Jefferies and other firms—including Swiss banking giant  UBS  —have come under for their ties to privately held First Brands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late September.  First Brands was little-known outside the worlds of car parts and auto financing, but has captured overwhelming attention because its failure appeared to blindside sophisticated investors.
