BENGALURU, India (Reuters) -Chevron India on Thursday opened a 312,000-square-foot facility for its Engineering and Innovation Excellence Center (ENGINE) in Bengaluru, a year after launching the unit to consolidate technical work and deepen its digital and artificial intelligence capabilities.  The expansion underscores India's growing role in the energy transition as technology becomes central to cost reduction and competitiveness.  "We were a very decentralized organization until recently," Akshay Sahni, country head for Chevron in India, told Reuters, adding the center aims at efficiency.
