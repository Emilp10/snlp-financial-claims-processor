Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is facing legal action from thousands of people in the UK who are accusing the global healthcare giant of knowingly selling talcum powder contaminated with asbestos.  More than 3,000 people allege they or a family member developed forms of ovarian cancer or mesothelioma from using Johnson's baby powder between 1965 and 2023.  A lawsuit has been filed by KP Law at the High Court in London seeking damages against J&J and Kenvue UK, which was split from the former in 2023 and now operates as a separate business.
