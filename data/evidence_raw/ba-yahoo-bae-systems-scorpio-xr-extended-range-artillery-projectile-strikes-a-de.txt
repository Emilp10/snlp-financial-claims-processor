BAE Systems (LON: BA) and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center (DEVCOM AC) successfully tested the Scorpio-XR artillery projectile from a 155mm howitzer. With multiple shots significantly exceeding test objective requirements by guiding to and impacting the target, the tests demonstrated the compatibility of the Scorpio-XR rounds with 155mm 52-caliber Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding howitzers.
