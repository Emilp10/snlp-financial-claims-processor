General Motors surged at Tuesday's stock market open after the auto giant handily topped third-quarter earnings and revenue views, while raising guidance and reducing its expected tariff impact for 2025.  GM announced early Tuesday that Q3 EPS fell 5% to $2.80 while revenue declined less than 1% to $48.59 billion.
