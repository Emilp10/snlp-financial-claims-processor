Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAFV600-mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone
