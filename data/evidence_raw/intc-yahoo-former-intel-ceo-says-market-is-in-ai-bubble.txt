Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said “of course” the market is in an AI-fueled bubble, adding that he hopes the investment frenzy will help spur more domestic energy production.  The U.S. and China aren't just in a race for rare-earth minerals and semiconductor dominance, but also for energy, he said.
