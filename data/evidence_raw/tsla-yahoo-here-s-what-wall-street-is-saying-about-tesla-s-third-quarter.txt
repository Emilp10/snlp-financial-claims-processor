Tesla stock is covered by more than 50 analysts, according to FactSet.  “A major focus on the conference call will be the robotaxi rollout across the US, volume production trajectory for Cybercabs/Optimus in 2026, and the timing of any new models set to hit the road early next year,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a preview report.  Tesla uses AI to train its cars to drive themselves.
