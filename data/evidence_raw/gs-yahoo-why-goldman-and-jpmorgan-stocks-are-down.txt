Shares in Goldman Sachs dropped 3% and JPMorgan was off 2% Tuesday, despite both Wall Street firms beating analyst expectations with their third-quarter results.  “Goldman and JPMorgan are best-in-class, global investment banks that beat due to investment banking," said Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.  Heading into Tuesday's trading, Goldman was up 56% over the past six months and JPMorgan was up some 30%.
