Johnson & Johnson  reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday, while announcing it would spin off a slower-growing division within its medical devices segment that makes hip and knee implants.  Now, Johnson & Johnson plans to separate that business into a new company that will operate under the name DePuy Synthes.  While sales for Johnson & Johnson’s medical devices division grew 5.6% on an operational basis between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2025, orthopaedics sales grew more slowly, up just 2.4% over the same period.
