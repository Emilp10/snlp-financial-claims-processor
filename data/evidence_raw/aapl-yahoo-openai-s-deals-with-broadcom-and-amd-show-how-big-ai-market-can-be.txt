AMD also landed a major order from Oracle Corp. this week, further juicing its shares.  Meanwhile, Broadcom unveiled its own agreement with OpenAI on Monday, sending its shares up 10% in a single session, their best performance since April.  “OpenAI clearly can’t rely just on Nvidia,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which has less than $70 million in assets under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
