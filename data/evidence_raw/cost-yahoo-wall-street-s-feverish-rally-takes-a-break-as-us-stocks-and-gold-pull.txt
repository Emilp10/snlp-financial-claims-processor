Wall Street took a pause on Thursday as U.S. stocks and even the price of gold pulled back from record highs following torrid runs.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% from its latest all-time high for just its second loss in the last 10 days.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 243 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by 0.1%.
