Tesla stock was down 2% on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the company reporting third-quarter results, which are due out after the market close.  Shares of GE Vernova stock were off 2.3% in late trading at $571.85 after the power equipment supplier reported better-than-expected earnings.  It’s been a wild day for that stock: GE Vernova shares traded as high as $610 a share and as low as $533, with investors asking company management if things are as good as they can get.
