“AstraZeneca, the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the United Kingdom, is committing to offer Americans major discounts on their vast catalog of prescription drugs,” Trump said Friday in the Oval Office, where he was joined by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot.  The deal — similar to a pact announced last week by Pfizer Inc. — will see AstraZeneca slash what it charges for its medicines in exchange for three years of relief from threatened tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry.
