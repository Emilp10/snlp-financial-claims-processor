IonQ  claimed Tuesday to have achieved a “landmark result” in quantum computing, saying it set the highest two-qubit gate performance in history.  IonQ  said in a press release it achieved over 99.99% fidelity in its latest experiment.  To break that down, each quantum gate operation has a calculated ideal result as well as an actual result.
