Morgan Stanley’s deal follows a $10 billion sale on Tuesday by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a $5 billion deal by JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday.  The average yield for US investment-grade bonds hit a one-year low of 4.69% on Thursday while spreads remain at historically low levels of below 0.8 percentage point, meaning funding costs remain attractive for higher-rated borrowers.  Morgan Stanley’s deal is the only one in the market this Friday.
