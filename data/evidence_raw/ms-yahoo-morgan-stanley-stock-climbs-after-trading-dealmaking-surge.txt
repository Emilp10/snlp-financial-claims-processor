Morgan Stanley shares rose more than 5%, tops among large U.S. banks Wednesday, after its profit jumped in the third quarter, fueled by a surge in dealmaking and trading revenue. The New York-based bank joined Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other large banks that all beat profit and revenue forecasts for the quarter.
