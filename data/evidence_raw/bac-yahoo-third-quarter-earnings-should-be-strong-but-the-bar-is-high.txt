Third-quarter earnings season kicks off in earnest this week, with roughly 12% of the  reporting results, and it is shaping up to be a good one.  In a typical year, analysts start to get nervous about their third-quarter earnings per share forecasts, leading to downward revision that can contribute to a September selloff.  In fact, analysts normally would have cut between 3% and 4% since the end of June, but this was the first year since 2023 that that didn’t happen, notes Bank of America’s Equity and Quant Strategist Savita Subramanian on Monday.
