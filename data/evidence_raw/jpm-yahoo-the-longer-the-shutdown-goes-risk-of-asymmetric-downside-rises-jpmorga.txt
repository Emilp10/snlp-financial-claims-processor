Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan’s head of global markets strategy, said the longer the uncertainty around trade policy and the government shutdown persists, the risk of an “asymmetric downside” rises.  Right now, the record for the longest shutdown sits at 35 days and occurred during President Trump’s first administration.  JPMorgan’s medium term outlook for stocks is “constructive,” forecasting the S&P 500 at 7,000 by early 2026, the strategist said.
