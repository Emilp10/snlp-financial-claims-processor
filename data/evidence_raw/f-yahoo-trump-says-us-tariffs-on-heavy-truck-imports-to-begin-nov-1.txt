Trump originally said last month that heavy-duty truck levies would start Oct. 1, but that timeline slipped as officials heard appeals from companies concerned about the impact.  “Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%,” the president posted Monday, without offering further details.  Trump’s announcement is tied to a probe launched in April by the US Commerce Department into heavy truck imports.
