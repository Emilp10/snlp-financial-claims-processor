NextSilicon's has raised $300 million in funding and its flagship "Maverick-2" chip is designed to speed up precision scientific computing tasks such as modeling nuclear weapons.  On Wednesday, NextSilicon also disclosed for the first time that it is developing a complement to its main chip in the form of a new central processing unit, a market still dominated by Intel and AMD.
