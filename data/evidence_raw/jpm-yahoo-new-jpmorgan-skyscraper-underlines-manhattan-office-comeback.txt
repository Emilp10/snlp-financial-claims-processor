JPMorgan Chase officially inaugurated its new Manhattan tower Tuesday, a 60-story skyscraper that also marks a kind of comeback of office working after the pandemic years.When the pandemic halted city life in its tracks in March 2020, JPMorgan had just finished the demolition of its old headquarters building at the same address, which had stood for 60 years.
