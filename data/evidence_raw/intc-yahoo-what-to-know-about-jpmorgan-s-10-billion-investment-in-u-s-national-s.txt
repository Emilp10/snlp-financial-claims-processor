JPMorgan Chase said Monday that it would directly invest $10 billion in companies it deems critical to U.S. national security, part of an initiative to help protect the American economy as trade tensions with countries such as China escalate.  JPMorgan has already been involved in the Trump administration’s recent investments in companies it says are critical to safeguarding the security of the U.S.  In July, the bank and Goldman Sachs agreed to lend $1 billion to MP Materials, the biggest rare-earth producer in the U.S. The funds will be used to build a new factory to produce rare-earth magnets, which MP Materials sells to companies such as Apple and General Motors.
