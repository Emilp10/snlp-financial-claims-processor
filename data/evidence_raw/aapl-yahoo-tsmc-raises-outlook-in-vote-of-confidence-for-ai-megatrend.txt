TSMC, the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and  Nvidia Corp., now foresees mid-30% growth in annual sales, up about a few percentage points from previously.  The outlook hike was striking given Taiwan’s biggest company last raised its guidance just three months ago, igniting a rally that’s tacked on more than $260 billion to its market value.  The results underscore how TSMC remains one of the bigger beneficiaries of a spending spree on AI infrastructure that’s expected to cross the $1 trillion mark in coming years.
