President Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday that the cost of Ozempic, or "the fat loss drug," could be $150—or "much lower" than the current cost.  Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator, jumped in to say the cost of those drugs hadn't yet been negotiated.  The administration is negotiating the price of drugs with several pharmaceutical companies and has already struck deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
