Meta Platforms  and its partner raised $27 billion in private debt to fund the construction of its Hyperion data center in Louisiana.  Bond manager  Pimco  was the biggest buyer, accounting for around $18 billion, while asset manager  BlackRock  bought more than $3 billion of bonds, The Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Hyperion project is 80%-owned by private-credit manager  Blue Owl Capital  while Meta, Facebook’s parent, owns the remaining 20% stake.
