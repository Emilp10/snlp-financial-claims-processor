Amazon.com’s Prime Big Deal Days were a hit with deal-hunting consumers looking to stock up on household essentials, early data suggests.  Analysts expected Amazon’s two-day October sale, which ended Wednesday, to kick-start the holiday shopping season.  Amazon’s website traffic increased about 21% in the first 36 hours of Prime Big Deal Days compared with the prior five days, marking a “robust response” to the sales, writes Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, citing data from Google Trends.
