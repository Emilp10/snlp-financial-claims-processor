Bank of America’s chief financial officer told reporters that the lender had worked on an asset-backed loan deal for the bankrupt auto-parts company First Brands.  “We’re in the syndicated loan for the First Brands deal,” Alastair Borthwick said in response to a question from Barron’s, adding, “when we think about prudent risk management, we're thinking about the borrower, we're thinking about the collateral, and here, we're secured.”  A spokeswoman for Bank of America declined to specify the impact the work for First Brands had on quarterly earnings.
