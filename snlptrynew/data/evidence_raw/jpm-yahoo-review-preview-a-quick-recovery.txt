Stocks sank on Friday on an apparent escalation of the trade war between Washington and Beijing.  On Monday, they bounced much of the way back after President Donald Trump said over the weekend, “Don’t worry about China.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 588 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.2%.
