Blue Owl Capital Inc. and Meta will split ownership of the Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, with the tech giant retaining just 20% of it, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  To finance the build-out, Morgan Stanley arranged over $27 billion of debt and about $2.5 billion of equity into a special purpose vehicle — a structure for large deals that’s becoming increasingly common.
