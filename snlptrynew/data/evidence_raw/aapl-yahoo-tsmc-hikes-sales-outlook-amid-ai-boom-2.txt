Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. hiked its projection for 2025 revenue growth to the mid-30% range. The company also raised the lower end of its capital spending target for the year after reporting a better-than-anticipated 39% jump in profit in the September quarter. TSMC is the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and most of the world's biggest semiconductor designers. The results show Taiwan's largest company remains one of the bigger beneficiaries of a spending spree on AI infrastructure. Bloomberg Intelligence's Matthew Bloxham breaks down the numbers.
