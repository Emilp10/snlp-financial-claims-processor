(Reuters) -Multi-billion dollar deals between AI firms and computer chipmakers are expected to strengthen top semiconductor equipment maker ASML's outlook when it reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.  Investors and analysts expect to see evidence that customers of the Dutch firm, such as TSMC and SK Hynix, are stepping up plans to expand capacity in 2026 and beyond.  Expectations are high following a 32% run-up in ASML shares since September 2, against a 15% rise in the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in the same period.
