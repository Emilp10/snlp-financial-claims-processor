Bentonville, Ark.—A decade ago, the largest private employer in the U.S.,  Walmart  increased its starting wage to $9 an hour.  Raising the salaries of nearly half of its more than a million U.S. hourly workers made it the biggest pay raise in history.  This fall, Walmart’s experience will be published as a Harvard Business School case study—as a success.
