Goldman Sachs  reported a stronger-than-expected profit in the third quarter, with the bank now on pace for its best year ever in its main investment-banking and markets division.  Wall Street’s engines are gaining steam thanks to a booming stock market and growing appetite in corporate boardrooms and executive suites to pursue mergers or public offerings.  “Taking a step back, there is no question there’s a fair amount of investor exuberance at the moment,” Solomon said.
