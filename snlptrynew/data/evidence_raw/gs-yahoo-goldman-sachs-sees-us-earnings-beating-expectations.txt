Christian Mueller-Glissmann, asset allocation research head at Goldman Sachs, says he is still "modestly pro-risk" on equities. "We're going into this earnings season with a view that it probably will validate that the corporate sector is still in relatively good shape," Mueller-Glissmann tells Bloomberg Television. "In the US in particular, the expectations, which are roughly 6% for that season, they probably will be beat again."
