Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk says the company is well positioned for a strong 2026 and discusses plans to spin off its slower-growing orthopedics business and the outlook for drug pricing on "Bloomberg Open Interest." J&J announced third-quarter sales and earnings that modestly beat expectations, and raised revenue guidance for the full year.
