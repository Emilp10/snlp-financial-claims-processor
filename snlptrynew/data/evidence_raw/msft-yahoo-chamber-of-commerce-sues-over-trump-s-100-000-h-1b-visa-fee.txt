The US Chamber of Commerce said in a lawsuit Thursday that it was illegal for President Donald Trump to slap a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications because it overrides federal immigration law requirements.  “The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.  The Chamber polled its members over whether they would be willing to join a lawsuit against the H-1B visa policy change after Trump disclosed the fee in September.
