Robinson, the pride of Eden Prairie, Minn., and one of the world’s biggest freight logistics and shipping companies, though he likes to think of the 100-plus-year-old company (founded by one Charles Henry Robinson) as a technology enterprise.  Bozeman is a Midwestern guy through and through, with an MS in engineering management from the Milwaukee School of Engineering and a BS in manufacturing design from Bradley University in Peoria, Ill. He worked at  Caterpillar  (also in Peoria),  Harley-Davidson  Ford, and Amazon before working at C.H. Robinson, which arranges for goods to be shipped by planes, trucks, ships, and rail.
