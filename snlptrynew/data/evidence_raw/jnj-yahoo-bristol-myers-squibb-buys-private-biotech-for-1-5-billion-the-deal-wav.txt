The recent cavalcade of biotech deals continued Friday morning, when  Bristol Myers Squibb  said it had agreed to pay $1.5 billion to acquire Orbital Therapeutics, an early-stage, privately held biotech designing RNA-based medicines.  Its lead program, a potential treatment for autoimmune conditions called OTX-201, isn’t expected to enter human trials until next year.  The Orbital deal is Bristol’s largest since February 2024, when it closed a $4.1 billion acquisition of RayzeBio, a cancer-focused biotech.
