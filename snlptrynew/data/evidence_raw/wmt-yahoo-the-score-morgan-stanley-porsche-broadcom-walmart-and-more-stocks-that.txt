Porsche   wants a new driver to get the German automaker back on course.  Porsche said Friday that it would start talks with Chief Executive  Oliver Blume  about an early exit, and with former McLaren Automotive boss  Michael Leiters  about taking the wheel.  Blume is also CEO of Volkswagen—Porsche’s majority owner—and his dual role has long attracted criticism.
