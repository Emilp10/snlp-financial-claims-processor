STORY: Lawyers accused some of the world's biggest carmakers of manipulating diesel emissions tests.The claims were made at London's High Court Monday by the legal representatives of 1.6 million claimants at the start of a huge trial.Owners of diesel vehicles made by certain brands between 2012 and 2017 allege the companies cheated emissions tests and are suing.The accused include Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Nissan, Renault, and Stellantis-owned Peugeot and Citroen.The manufacturers are accused of using unlawful "defeat devices" which detected when vehicles were being tested.The devices allegedly ensured nitrogen oxide emissions were kept within legal limits under test conditions.The claimants' lawyers argue the emissions were far higher when the cars were on the road, and in some cases up to 12 times test limits.They said this caused harm to the environment and entitled consumers to compensation.But the carmakers have called the claims fundamentally flawed.They argue there are justified reasons why systems to control emissions are calibrated to work differently in certain conditions.They also reject any similarity with 2015's 'Dieselgate' scandal, when Volkswagen admitted using defeat devices.It cost the German auto giant billions of dollars.The trial is due to conclude next year.
