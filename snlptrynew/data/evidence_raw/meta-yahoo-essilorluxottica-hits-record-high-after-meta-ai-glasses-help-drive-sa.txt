(Reuters) -Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica hit an all-time high on Friday, surging over 10% after the eyewear giant's record quarter showed sales of its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gaining momentum.  The AI-powered glasses contributed over four percentage points to sales growth, said Chief Financial Officer Stefano Grassi, with demand prompting EssilorLuxottica to accelerate production capacity plans for the glasses ahead of schedule.  EssilorLuxottica's shares were up 11.7% by 0754GMT, trading up to 308 euros, and were on track to rise the most in over eight years.
