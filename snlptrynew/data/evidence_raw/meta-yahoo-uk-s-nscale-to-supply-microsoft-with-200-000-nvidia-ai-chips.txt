The Nvidia-backed company did not disclose the financial terms, but the Financial Times reported it could generate up to $14 billion in revenue for the startup, based on a comparable contract.  The agreement will be executed in collaboration with Dell Technologies.  Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
