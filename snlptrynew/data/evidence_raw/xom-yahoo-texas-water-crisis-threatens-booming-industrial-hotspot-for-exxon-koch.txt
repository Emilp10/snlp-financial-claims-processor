Corpus Christi, a Gulf Coast city 400 miles (640 kilometers) south of Dallas, is in the grip of a worsening drought that’s already prompted lawn-watering bans and warnings that harsher restrictions may be necessary.  The city council recently halted work on a desalination plant that would have treated seawater after cost estimates spiraled to more than $1 billion and sparked outrage among some residents.  The issue also tapped into long-simmering resentment of the growing industrial presence of major water users such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Koch Industries LLC, Celanese Corp., and Occidental Petroleum Corp.
