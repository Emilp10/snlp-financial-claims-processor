Unlike other corporate leaders, Gap Chief Executive Officer Richard Dickson hasn’t shied away from political conversation, encouraging employees to “share opinions” in a memo sent after the assassination of political commentator Charlie Kirk, Bloomberg News previously reported.  Dickson and his government affairs team have also spoken directly with Trump and his administration about tariffs.
