Global CEOs including Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook on Thursday met top trade Chinese negotiator He Lifeng in Beijing, a gathering that coincided with an uptick in trade tensions between China and the US.  The business executives are part of an advisory board for Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management that typically gathers every year and Cook is the chair of that committee.
