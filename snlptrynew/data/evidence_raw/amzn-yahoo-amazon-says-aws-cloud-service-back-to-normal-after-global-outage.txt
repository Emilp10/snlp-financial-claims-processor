STORY: Amazon Web Services returned to normal operations on Monday afternoon, the company said.That was after a major internet outage that disrupted thousands of sites worldwide including some of the web's most popular apps like Snapchat and Reddit.Despite being back online, Amazon says some AWS systems are still working through a backlog of messages, which could take a few hours to process.The outage had a global impact.AWS powers applications and systems for companies across the world, and the disruption left workers from London to Tokyo offline.Everyday tasks from paying a hairdresser to rescheduling flights were suddenly halted. Even on Monday afternoon, users reported lingering issues with services like digital wallet Venmo and video calling site Zoom.This marks the most significant internet disruption since last year’s CrowdStrike malfunction, which crippled hospitals, banks and airports underscoring just how fragile the interconnected digital world can be.It was at least the third major incident in five years linked to AWS’s US-EAST-1 data center in northern Virginia.Amazon did not address a request for more clarity on why this particular region keeps being affected.The root of the problem was traced to the Domain Name System, or DNS, which prevented applications from finding the correct address for AWS's DynamoDB API, a cloud database critical for storing data.
