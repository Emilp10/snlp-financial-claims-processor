(Reuters) -T-Mobile added more than 1 million monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers to top estimates in the third quarter and raised its annual forecast, powered by a wave of customers switching from rivals during the crucial iPhone launch period.  For U.S. wireless carriers, the reported quarter is seasonally critical as Apple's latest iPhone models typically trigger a spike in upgrades and new subscriptions.  T-Mobile's premium plans have helped it win a larger share of "jump-balls" in what analysts have described as a "musical chairs" environment.
