STORY: Shares of General Motors surged more than 15% Tuesday morning after the company raised is profit outlook, putting them on track for their biggest single day jump in six years.The automaker says the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on its business has been less than expected.GM also said it is experiencing lighter losses on electric cars, as it unwinds massive bets it made on the technology.CEO Mary Barra told investors in a letter that, quote, "It is now clear that near-term EV (electric vehicle) adoption will be lower than planned," citing changing regulations. "By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond.”Though she added the vehicles remain its “North Star.”GM’s quarterly adjusted earnings per share fell but topped expectations. Revenue marginally declined from a year earlier.Still, GM's results could be hampered by supply chain disruptions, additional EV charges and increased warranty costs.U.S. car sales have stayed strong despite uncertainty around tariffs, rising 6% in the third quarter. While automakers have largely avoided raising sticker prices to offset their tariff costs, American car shoppers have continued to opt for pricier models and added features.Automakers have also been ramping up U.S. investments to help deal with Trump’s tariffs. GM announced in June that it would invest $4 billion at three U.S. facilities in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. The automaker has previously imported about half of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., mainly from Mexico and South Korea.
