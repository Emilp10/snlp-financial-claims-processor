Meta Platforms  is cutting about 600 jobs in its AI division, according to an internal memo that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and a person familiar with the matter.  The job cuts will affect the company’s teams focused on artificial-intelligence products, infrastructure and long-term AI research, but won’t touch TBD Lab, the new team that houses most of Meta Chief Executive  Mark Zuckerberg’s  multimillion-dollar hires, the memo said.
