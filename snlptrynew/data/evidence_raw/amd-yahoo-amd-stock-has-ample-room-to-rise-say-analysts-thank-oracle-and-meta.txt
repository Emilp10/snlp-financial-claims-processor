Shares of  Advanced Micro Devices  lifted recently by partnerships with major players in artificial intelligence, could keep gaining regardless of stiff competition among chip makers.  The stock was down 1% to $232.35 on Friday, a level leaving room for a gain of more than 29% to BofA Securities’ target.  Intel  and  Nvidia  were each up 0.3%.
