Boeing [NYSE: BA], in partnership with Southwest Airlines (SWA) and Aeroxchange Ltd., has successfully completed the aerospace industry's first parts shipment accompanied by a digital 8130-3 certificate—an electronic version of the FAA-governed 8130-3 Authorized Release Certificate. This milestone advances supply chain security by preventing unapproved spare parts from entering the aerospace aftermarket.
