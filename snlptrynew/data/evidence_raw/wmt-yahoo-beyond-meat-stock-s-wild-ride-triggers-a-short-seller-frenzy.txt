Like the meme-stock frenzies of years past, shares of the vegetarian “meat” purveyor have been caught in the whiplash of retail traders’ short attention spans.  Losses extended in premarket trading Thursday, with the shares falling as much as 22% to $2.80 as of 4:30 a.m. in New York.  “You’re getting two-way action on the short side — short covering for people that are getting squeezed, but more short selling for people that find this an attractive entry point,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners LLC.
