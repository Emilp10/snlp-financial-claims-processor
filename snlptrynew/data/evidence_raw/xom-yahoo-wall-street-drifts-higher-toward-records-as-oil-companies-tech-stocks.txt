U.S. stocks are drifting near their record heights on Thursday, as oil prices jump after President Donald Trump announced “massive” new sanctions on Russia’s crude industry.  Big U.S. oil companies helped drive the market higher, including gains of 1.3% for Exxon Mobil, 3.4% for ConocoPhillips and 4.1% for Diamondback Energy.  The hope is to convince Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to end the brutal war with Ukraine, and sanctions could constrict the global flow of oil.
