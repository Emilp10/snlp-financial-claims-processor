General Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.  The EV tax credit ended last month.  The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.
