DALLAS, October 21, 2025--Recent federal actions involving Tesla and Waymo are intensifying national debate over the safety, oversight, and transparency of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. The Witherite Law Group, which represents individuals injured or families who have lost loved ones in traffic crashes, warns that regulatory rollbacks and high-profile incidents expose major gaps in public safety and accountability.
