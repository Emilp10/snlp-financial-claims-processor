Oil prices were rising Monday after the OPEC+ cartel said it would hike its crude output by less than some market participants had expected.  The  Brent  international benchmark jumped 0.9% to $65.11 a barrel, and  West Texas Intermediate  U.S. prices rose 0.8% to $61.34 a barrel.  The moves came after OPEC+ and its allies agreed to raise production by  137,000 barrels a day for November, the same as its output hike for October.
