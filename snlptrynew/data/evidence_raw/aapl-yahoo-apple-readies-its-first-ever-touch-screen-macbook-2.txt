The company is readying a revamped MacBook Pro with a touch display for late 2026 or early 2027, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  In making the move, Apple is following the rest of the computing industry, which embraced touch-screen laptops more than a decade ago.  Bloomberg News first reported in January 2023 that Apple was working on a touch-screen MacBook Pro.
