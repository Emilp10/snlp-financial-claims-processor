The Commerce Department is slated to announce a five-year extension for an arrangement that allows automakers to reduce what they pay in tariffs on imported car parts, according to people familiar with the matter.  The announcement could come as soon as Friday, the people said, noting that similar tariff announcements have slipped.  The policy is expected to be detailed in government documents that also formally implement tariffs on imported trucks.
